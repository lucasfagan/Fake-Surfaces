# Classification of Acyclic Fake Surfaces
This repository contains the data for the classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces of complexity 1-4 and a partial classification of complexity 5. It also contains the  code used to generate the classification and check contractibility. 

## Checking Contractibility
For a given surface and maximal tree, we can put them at the top of this file as shown and then run ``sage check_contractibility.sage.`` It is also easy to modify the code to check multiple surfaces at once.
